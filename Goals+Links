Project goals:
*intercept and block all chat messages containing /u/ and /r/ links (including messages send by other plugins)
*edit the /u/ and /r/ links to be clickable using json text formating
*send the edited message

Possible problems:
*making sure the messages aren't delivered to the wrong person/ broadcasted to everyone
*making sure to keep all formating intact ($a codes, prefixes, etc)

Possible fix
*if possible, only edit thethe message and then let it go through
